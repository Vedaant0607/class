Once upon a time a turtle and his friend were walking in a footpath of the forest.
While walking a rabit comes out of the bushes and surprised them and told the turtle 
he was very slow so the turtle gets offended and challenges the rabbit to a race. 
the race was hel the next day and it began in one corner of the forest and ended at the other.
the race starts and the rabbit quickly runs and reaches the half point in the race 
in his overconfidence he went to a tree close to him and started sleeping by the time he woke 
up the turtle had almost completed.the rabbit started running but he could not reach in time 
and the turtle won.
